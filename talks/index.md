## Expository Presentations

There are several talks I've given in seminars and other settings which do not have slides --- either they can be found on the [notes]({{site.baseurl }}/notes) page or I have not transcribed my handwritten notes into LaTeX yet. The following are the non-research presentations I've given with slides. 

* Optimization Landscape for Tensor Decompositions <a href="{{site.baseurl }}/talks/TensorDecompositionsELE538B_knv.pdf" title="landscape_tensor_decomp"> [slides] </a>
 
* A Survey on Image Captioning with Deep Learning<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/talks/598b_img_captions.pdf" title="598c_img_cap"> [slides] </a>

* A Survey on Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/talks/598b_nlp_deep_learning.pdf" title="598c_nlp"> [slides] </a>
