# Expository Presentations

There are several talks I've given in seminars and other settings which do not have slides --- either they can be found on the [notes]({{site.baseurl }}/notes) page or I have not transcribed my handwritten notes into LaTeX yet. 

* Optimization Landscape for Tensor Decompositions <a href="{{site.baseurl }}/talks/TensorDecompositionsELE538B_knv.pdf" title="landscape_tensor_decomp"> [slides] </a>
 
* A Survey on Image Captioning with Deep Learning<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/talks/598b_img_captions.pdf" title="598c_img_cap"> [slides] </a>
My second presentation for <a href = "http://vision.princeton.edu/courses/COS598/2015sp/" title="COS 598B website"> COS 598B </a> focused on the image captioning problem, and deep learning approaches to solving it.

* A Survey on Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/talks/598b_nlp_deep_learning.pdf" title="598c_nlp"> [slides] </a>
My first presentation for the Spring 2015 offering of <a href = "http://vision.princeton.edu/courses/COS598/2015sp/" title="COS 598B website"> COS 598B </a>, an advanced topics class on deep learning. I overviewed various approaches to solving NLP problems with deep learning approaches, with a stronger focus on language models and word vector embeddings.
