## Overview


### Goals

We are interested in exploring the relationships between different measurements of brain activity, namely, fMRI, MEG, and EEG. fMRI data is based on a time series of BOLD responses and takes the form of a $$4$$-vector with high spatial resolution, but low temporal resolution. On the other hand, both MEG (recordings of magnetic fields induced by electrical currents in the brain) and EEG (recording voltage fluctuations due to ion movement inside neurons) data have high temporal resolution, but less spatial resolution. Therefore, the primary question we ask for our project is: Can we utilize fMRI and (EEG or MEG) data, recorded simultaneously on a set of subjects performing some task, to jointly create a new signal that is able to retain both spatial and temporal resolution from the inputs to achieve a higher resolution on both axes?  

### The Dataset

We are using the Auditory and Visual Oddball EEG-fMRI dataset, available for download at the following <a href= "https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000116" title= "https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000116"> link </a>. The complete description of the data is available at the provided link.
