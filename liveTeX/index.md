I attend various academic talks at seminars, symposia, and conferences and sometimes scribe them (liveTeXing). The notes for the talks on this page correspond to individual talks rather than a lecture series or a full set of notes for a class.

### Seminars

<!-- add seminar names and organize by them (e.g., Princeton Alg-ML; Columbia CS) --> 

* ManOpt: Manifold Optimization <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/liveTeX/boumal_manopt.pdf">[pdf]</a>: Nicholas Boumal from Princeton gave a talk at the Alg-ML Reading Group on manifold optimization and ManOpt, his tool for solving optimization problems. 
* Computational Thinking, Inferential Thinking, and Data Science <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/liveTeX/mike_jordan_general.pdf">[pdf]</a>: Professor Michael Jordan from Berkeley gave a general talk on the trends towards intersecting the statistical, computer science, and optimization communities. The discussion includes inferential differential privacy, inferential communication theory, inferential computation theory, and finally, an aside on a general framework for accelerated Nesterov methods. 
* Universality Laws for Randomized Dimension Reduction <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/liveTeX/tropp_algml.pdf">[pdf]</a>: Professor Joel Tropp from CalTech CMS gave a talk at Alg-ML on the quality of random matrices from fairly arbitrary distributions such that the image of the random projection matrix does not intersect the origin (nothing in the original dataset gets collapsed to zero). It turns out that computationally efficient random matrix distributions, like sparse Rademacher matrices, provably obey the same phase transition laws as Gaussian random matrices for the condition that the image does not intersect the nullspace, which allows for considerable computational speedups. Additionally, there are also provable bounds on the stability of such random matrix projections.
* Finding Structure With Randomness <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/liveTeX/tropp_structure_rand.pdf">[pdf]</a>: Professor Joel Tropp from CalTech CMS gave a talk on another approach to approximating low-rank SVD in a manner appropriate for very large matrices.
* Nonparametric Bayesian and Combinatorial Stochastic Processes <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/liveTeX/michael_jordan_bayes.pdf">[pdf]</a>: Professor Michael Jordan gave a talk on applications and theory of nonparametric Bayesian statistics.

* Linear Coupling Framework of Gradient and Mirror Descent <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/liveTeX/zeyuan_opt_talk.pdf">[pdf]</a>: Dr. Zeyuan Allen-Zhu explains Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent with a nice framework involving analysis of alternating gradient and mirror descent, and also shows that strong linear coupling approaches can also be applied to the analysis of other settings (for instance, coordinate gradient descent and even some nonconvex cases) to get robust improved convergence rates, in addition to intuitively explaining the opaque Nesterov acceleration. 
* LiSSA: A Linear Time Second-Order Stochastic Algorithm <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/liveTeX/linear_stoc_opt.pdf">[pdf]</a>: In this result, joint with Professor Elad Hazan at Princeton, Naman Agarwal and Brian Bullins come up with a new algorithm based on a novel estimator of the inverse Hessian which allows for a theoretical linear time convergence rate for an algorithm which uses full second-order information. Empirically, the algorithm (called LiSSA) also performs well with respect to its competition. 
* Computationally Feasible Greedy Algorithms for Neural Networks <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/liveTeX/barron_nns.pdf">[pdf]</a>: Professor Andrew Barron from Yale discussed ways approaches from the greedy algorithms literature with accompanying statistical risk bounds can be applied to bounding the expected error of single-layer neural networks.

The formalism takes advantage of kernels to define an approximate minimization problem, adding more insight into how to tackle the problem of explaining convolutional networks theoretically.
* Divide-and-Conquer Matrix Completion <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/liveTeX/lester_mackey_matrix_completion_concentration.pdf">[pdf]</a>: Professor Lester Mackey from Stanford talks on his recent work for the fast-parallelization of matrix completion under a novel divide and conquer framework.

He also describes robust dynamics optimization (RDO), a framework for solving optimization problems over a set of points defined by a dynamical system.

This barrier is related to the heuristic simulated annealing approach often taken in non-convex optimization. 
* Joint Independent Subspace Analysis and Blind Source Separation <a href= "{{ site.baseurl }}/liveTeX/joint-ISA.pdf" title="joint-ISA">[pdf]</a>: Dana Lahat gives an overview of blind source separation with various statistical independence assumptions, generalizing ICA to learning subspaces of low-rank instead of just rank \\(1\\) subspaces.
