<!-- add seminar names and organize by them (e.g., Princeton Alg-ML; Columbia CS) -->

<ul>
  <li>ManOpt: Manifold Optimization <a href="/liveTeX/boumal_manopt.pdf">[pdf]</a>: Nicholas Boumal from Princeton gave a talk at the Alg-ML Reading Group on manifold optimization and ManOpt, his tool for solving optimization problems.</li>
  <li>Computational Thinking, Inferential Thinking, and Data Science <a href="/liveTeX/mike_jordan_general.pdf">[pdf]</a>: Professor Michael Jordan from Berkeley gave a general talk on the trends towards intersecting the statistical, computer science, and optimization communities. The discussion includes inferential differential privacy, inferential communication theory, inferential computation theory, and finally, an aside on a general framework for accelerated Nesterov methods.</li>
  <li>Universality Laws for Randomized Dimension Reduction <a href="/liveTeX/tropp_algml.pdf">[pdf]</a>: Professor Joel Tropp from CalTech CMS gave a talk at Alg-ML on the quality of random matrices from fairly arbitrary distributions such that the image of the random projection matrix does not intersect the origin (nothing in the original dataset gets collapsed to zero). It turns out that computationally efficient random matrix distributions, like sparse Rademacher matrices, provably obey the same phase transition laws as Gaussian random matrices for the condition that the image does not intersect the nullspace, which allows for considerable computational speedups. Additionally, there are also provable bounds on the stability of such random matrix projections.</li>
  <li>Finding Structure With Randomness <a href="/liveTeX/tropp_structure_rand.pdf">[pdf]</a>: Professor Joel Tropp from CalTech CMS gave a talk on another approach to approximating low-rank SVD in a manner appropriate for very large matrices.</li>
  <li>Nonparametric Bayesian and Combinatorial Stochastic Processes <a href="/liveTeX/michael_jordan_bayes.pdf">[pdf]</a>: Professor Michael Jordan gave a talk on applications and theory of nonparametric Bayesian statistics.</li>

  <li>Linear Coupling Framework of Gradient and Mirror Descent <a href="/liveTeX/zeyuan_opt_talk.pdf">[pdf]</a>: Dr. Zeyuan Allen-Zhu explains Nesterov’s accelerated gradient descent with a nice framework involving analysis of alternating gradient and mirror descent, and also shows that strong linear coupling approaches can also be applied to the analysis of other settings (for instance, coordinate gradient descent and even some nonconvex cases) to get robust improved convergence rates, in addition to intuitively explaining the opaque Nesterov acceleration.</li>
  <li>LiSSA: A Linear Time Second-Order Stochastic Algorithm <a href="/liveTeX/linear_stoc_opt.pdf">[pdf]</a>: In this result, joint with Professor Elad Hazan at Princeton, Naman Agarwal and Brian Bullins come up with a new algorithm based on a novel estimator of the inverse Hessian which allows for a theoretical linear time convergence rate for an algorithm which uses full second-order information. Empirically, the algorithm (called LiSSA) also performs well with respect to its competition.</li>
  <li>Computationally Feasible Greedy Algorithms for Neural Networks <a href="/liveTeX/barron_nns.pdf">[pdf]</a>: Professor Andrew Barron from Yale discussed ways approaches from the greedy algorithms literature with accompanying statistical risk bounds can be applied to bounding the expected error of single-layer neural networks.</li>

The formalism takes advantage of kernels to define an approximate minimization problem, adding more insight into how to tackle the problem of explaining convolutional networks theoretically.</li>

  <li>Reversible Deep Nets <a href="/liveTeX/deepnets-reversible-arora.pdf" title="deepnets-reversible-arora">[pdf]</a>: Professor Sanjeev Arora, Tengyu Ma, and Yingyu Liang discuss their results on giving a generative model for reversible deep nets. They also give a better training method that improves upon Dropout.</li>
  <li>The Complexity of Detecting Planted Solutions <a href="/liveTeX/planted-graph-vempala.pdf" title="vempala">[pdf]</a>: Professor Santosh Vempala of Georgia Tech gave a talk on showing that for statistical algorithms (e.g. PCA, EM, and so on), solving planted clique and planted \(k\)-SAT is at least exponential time in the size of the input.</li>
  <li>Optimizing over Nonnegative Polynomials <a href="/liveTeX/ahmadi.pdf" title="ahmadi">[pdf]</a>: Professor Amir Ali Ahmadi from Princeton spoke about formulating convex optimization problems in terms of finding nonnegative polynomials to provably optimize various problems in controls, dynamical systems, and machine learning, improving upon the time complexity of previous sum-of-squares SDP relaxations. He also describes robust dynamics optimization (RDO), a framework for solving optimization problems over a set of points defined by a dynamical system.</li>
  <li>Decoding Generic Representations of fMRI <a href="/liveTeX/pereira-words.pdf" title="pereira-words">[pdf]</a>: Dr. Francisco Pereira from Siemens talked about his work using sentences and pictures to localize fMRI voxels for representing semantic content in brains.</li>
  <li>Simulated Annealing and Interior Point Methods <a href="/liveTeX/hazan-annealing.pdf" title="hazan-annealing">[pdf]</a>: Professor Elad Hazan gave a talk to Princeton’s Algorithm-ML reading group on a result demonstrating the existence of a universal barrier function for interior point methods in the membership oracle model of convex optimization. This barrier is related to the heuristic simulated annealing approach often taken in non-convex optimization.</li>
  <li>Joint Independent Subspace Analysis and Blind Source Separation <a href="/liveTeX/joint-ISA.pdf" title="joint-ISA">[pdf]</a>: Dana Lahat gives an overview of blind source separation with various statistical independence assumptions, generalizing ICA to learning subspaces of low-rank instead of just rank \(1\) subspaces.</li>
