## My Talks, Posters, and Talk Notes

### Optimization Landscape for Tensor Decompositions <a href="{{site.baseurl }}/talks/TensorDecompositionsELE538B_knv.pdf" title="landscape_tensor_decomp"> [pdf] </a>

Also see my summary of tensor decompositions <a href="{{site.baseurl }}/talks/tensor_writeup.pdf" title="tensor_decomp"> [pdf] </a>.

### Rate Distortion and Unsupervised Learning <a href="{{site.baseurl }}/talks/rate-distortion_presentation.pdf" title="rate_distortion"> [pdf] </a>

### Matrix Concentration <a href="{{site.baseurl }}/talks/final_project_matrix_concentration.pdf" title="matrix_concentration"> [pdf] </a>

### Mappings Between fMRI Responses and Natural Language Descriptions of Natural Stimuli (see <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811917305128" title="neuroimage"> [NeuroImage paper] </a>)

Also see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03914" title="neuroimage_arxiv"> arXiv prepub </a>. These talks/posters are all in relation to this paper. Given fMRI data of several people watching a movie and semantic annotations of the movie, the goal of this work is to decode both directions: from fMRI to text, and from text to fMRI. We use the Shared Response Model (<a href = "http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5855-a-reduced-dimension-fmri-shared-response-model" title = 'SRM'> Chen et al 2015 </a>) and linear models to achieve this task with state-of-the-art performance.

### Joel Tropp on Universality Laws for Randomized Dimension Reduction <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/notes/tropp_algml.pdf">[pdf]</a>

Professor Joel Tropp from CalTech CMS gave a talk at Alg-ML on the quality of random matrices from fairly arbitrary distributions such that the image of the random projection matrix does not intersect the origin (nothing in the original dataset gets collapsed to zero). It turns out that computationally efficient random matrix distributions, like sparse Rademacher matrices, provably obey the same phase transition laws as Gaussian random matrices for the condition that the image does not intersect the nullspace, which allows for considerable computational speedups. Additionally, there are also provable bounds on the stability of such random matrix projections.

### Joel Tropp on Finding Structure With Randomness <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/notes/tropp_structure_rand.pdf">[pdf]</a>

Dr. Zeyuan Allen Zhu explains Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent with a nice framework involving analysis of alternating gradient and mirror descent, and also shows that strong linear coupling approaches can also be applied to the analysis of other settings (for instance, coordinate gradient descent and even some nonconvex cases) to get robust improved convergence rates, in addition to intuitively explaining the opaque Nesterov acceleration. 

### Naman Agarwal and Brian Bullins on LiSSA: A Linear Time Second-Order Stochastic Algorithm <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/notes/linear_stoc_opt.pdf">[pdf]</a>

In this result, joint with Professor Elad Hazan at Princeton, the authors come up with a new algorithm based on a novel estimator of the inverse Hessian which allows for a theoretical linear time convergence rate for an algorithm which uses full second-order information. Empirically, the algorithm (called LiSSA) also performs well with respect to its competition. 

### Andrew Barron on Computationally Feasible Greedy Algorithms for Neural Networks <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/notes/barron_nns.pdf">[pdf]</a>

## Lecture Notes

For now, I have individual class notes for some classes I've taken. Usually, I prioritize scribing classes for which there is no good book already existing. At some point in the future, I plan to put together big documents of notes parametrized by subject in one big document.  

### MAT 529: Metric Embeddings  <a href= "https://www.dropbox.com/s/s6kh92p8pas6941/mat529.pdf?dl=0" title= "mat529"> [pdf]</a>

I took <a href= "http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring15/cos511/" title= "cos511"> scribe notes</a> for most lectures of this class in its Spring 2015 iteration. Topics in the notes consist of an introduction to statistical learning theory, the Online Convex Optimization (OCO) framework, regularization, Bandit Convex Optimization (BCO), boosting, some game theory all from the point of view of OCO, and finally, an explicit connection between OCO and statistical learning theory in the form of theorems which convert regret analysis into ERM guarantees. There are also two guest lectures, one by Professor Jake Abernethy of University of Michigan, and one by Professor Sanjeev Arora of Princeton. A lot of the notes follow the <a href="http://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu/OCObook.pdf" title="OCObook"> excellent book </a> by Professor Elad Hazan.
