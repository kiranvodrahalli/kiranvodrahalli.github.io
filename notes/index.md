As a general note, please contact me if you find errors in my notes so that I may fix them.

## Talks

I attend various talks at Princeton and sometimes scribe them.

### Ben Recht on Perceptron Learning and Stability
Professor Ben Recht from Berkeley discussed a notion of stability applied to stochastic gradient descent to explain why it reaches the same local optima in the nonconvex setting. 

### Tom Griffiths on Rationality, Heuristics, and the Cost of Computation

Professor Tom Griffiths from Berkeley discussed a notion of rationality which takes into account computation time as a resource. From his perspective, we can explain why some decision-making procedures which appear to be suboptimal are actually optimal from a sparse-resource respective.
