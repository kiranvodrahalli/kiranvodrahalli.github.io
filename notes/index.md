## Talks

I attend various talks at Princeton and sometimes scribe them.

### Dimitris Bertsimas on Statistics and Machine Learning from a Modern Optimization Lens <a href= "{{ site.baseurl }}/notes/SML_modern_optimization.pdf" title="MIOnotes">[pdf]</a>

Professor Dimitris Bertsimas from MIT gave a talk on using the mixed integer-programming (MIO) framework as a new lens through which to view machine learning, statistics, and optimization problems. 

### Sébastien Bubeck on Optimal Regret Bounds for the General Convex Multi-Armed Bandit Setting <a href= "{{ site.baseurl }}/notes/bubeck_talk.pdf" title="bubecknotes">[pdf]</a>

Dr. Sébastien Bubeck from Microsoft Research gave a talk to the Alg-ML reading group on his \\(2015\\) result on a tight minimax regret bound for the setting of general convex bandit optimization in dimensions greater than one. 

### Han Liu on Nonparametric Graphical Models <a href= "{{ site.baseurl }}/notes/han_liu_pni.pdf" title="hanliunotes">[pdf]</a>

Professor Han Liu from Princeton gave an overview of his recent research and theoretical results on nonparametric graphical models.

### Mehryar Mohri on Deep Boosting <a href= "{{ site.baseurl }}/notes/deep_boosting.pdf" title="mohrinotes">[pdf]</a>
Professor Mehryar Mohri from the Courant Institute speaks about ensemble boosting methods that take advantage of complex hypothesis classes along with the use of standard simple weak learners. He also presents an interpretation of boosting as truly being about model selection.

### Percy Liang on Learning Hidden Computational Processes <a href= "{{ site.baseurl }}/notes/percy_liang_talk.pdf" title="percyliangnotes">[pdf]</a>
Professor Percy Liang from Stanford discussed approaches to solving question-answering tasks on a new hand-built dataset. 

### Young Kun Ko on the Hardness of Sparse PCA  <a href= "{{ site.baseurl }}/notes/braverman_sparse_PCA.pdf" title="sparsepcanotes">[pdf]</a>

This talk summarizing two results on sparse principal components analysis was given to the Braverman Reading Group at Princeton.

### Ben Recht on Perceptron Learning and Stability
Professor Ben Recht from Berkeley discussed a notion of stability applied to stochastic gradient descent to explain why it reaches the same local optima in the nonconvex setting. Notes still to be added.

### Tom Griffiths on Rationality, Heuristics, and the Cost of Computation <a href= "{{ site.baseurl }}/notes/griffiths_rationality_heuristics_computationcost_berkeley.pdf" title="griffithsnotes">[pdf]</a>

Professor Tom Griffiths from Berkeley discussed a notion of rationality which takes into account computation time as a resource. From his perspective, we can explain why some decision-making procedures which appear to be suboptimal are actually optimal from a sparse-resource respective. 

### Anna Choromanska on Optimization for Large-Scale Machine Learning <a href= "{{ site.baseurl }}/notes/choromanska_deeplearning.pdf" title="choromanskanotes">[pdf]</a>

Dr. Choromanska from the Courant Institute talks about new learning algorithms for decision trees and spin-glass interpretations of deep learning.
