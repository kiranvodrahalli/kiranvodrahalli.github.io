I will graduate from [Princeton](https://www.princeton.edu) with an A.B. Mathematics degree in 2016, after which I will attend Princeton's M.S.E. Program in Computer Science from 2016-2017. 

My primary area of theoretical research is computational statistics and optimization. I am particularly interested in applications to natural language understanding and neuroscience.
