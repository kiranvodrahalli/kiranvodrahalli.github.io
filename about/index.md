### Currently...

I am a [Computer Science](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/) Ph.D. student at Columbia University, focusing on theoretical computer science, with particular interest in machine learning, algorithms, and statistics. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Professor Daniel Hsu](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~djhsu/) and [Professor Alex Andoni](http://www.mit.edu/~andoni/). I am supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

### Research Interests

My primary area of research is theoretical computer science: in particular, provably resource-efficient algorithms for fitting statistical models ("algorithmic statistics"). Several of my interests can be summarized by the phrase "non-worst-case analysis for machine learning algorithms." In applications, I am particularly interested in natural language understanding, neuroscience, economics, and robotics.

### Previously...

In Summer 2019 I visited the Simons Institute at Berkeley for the [Foundations of Deep Learning](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/dl2019) program. 

I graduated from [Princeton](https://www.princeton.edu) with an A.B. Mathematics degree with honors in 2016 and an M.S.E. in Computer Science in 2017, where I was lucky to have [Professor Sanjeev Arora](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arora/) and [Professor Ken Norman](https://psych.princeton.edu/person/kenneth-norman) as thesis advisors. I was a member of Sanjeev Arora's [Unsupervised Learning Group](http://unsupervised.cs.princeton.edu/members.html), where I studied provable methods for machine learning (also a part of [NLP @ Princeton](http://nlp.cs.princeton.edu/) and [ML Theory @Princeton](https://mltheory.cs.princeton.edu/people/)), in particular focusing on natural language understanding. I was also a member of Ken Norman's [Computational Memory Lab](http://compmem.princeton.edu/lab-people/) at the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute](http://pni.princeton.edu), where I applied machine learning to fMRI analysis methods.
