  My name is Kiran Vodrahalli.

From 2016-2017, I am attending Princeton's M.S.E. Program in Computer Science. I'm currently applying to Ph.D. programs in Computer Science, Statistics, and Applied Math. 

I graduated from [Princeton](https://www.princeton.edu) with an A.B. Mathematics degree with honors in 2016. 

My primary area of theoretical research is provable algorithms and models for computational inference and optimization. I am particularly interested in applications to natural language understanding and neuroscience.

I am currently a member of Professor Sanjeev Arora's [Unsupervised Learning Group](http://unsupervised.cs.princeton.edu/), which studies provable methods for various unsupervised algorithms. Some applications of particular interest relate to natural language understanding. I am also supervised by Professor Ken Norman at the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute](http://pni.princeton.edu).
