I will graduate from [Princeton](https://www.princeton.edu) with an A.B. Mathematics degree in 2016, after which I will attend Princeton's M.S.E. Program in Computer Science from 2016-2017. 

My primary area of theoretical research is provable algorithms and models for computational inference and optimization. I am particularly interested in applications to natural language understanding and neuroscience.

I am currently a member of Professor Sanjeev Arora's [Unsupervised Learning Group](http://unsupervised.cs.princeton.edu/), which studies provable methods for various unsupervised algorithms. Some applications of particular interest relate to natural language understanding.

For more details, either check out this website or see the essentials summarized in my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/cv.pdf" title="cv"> curriculum vitae </a>.
